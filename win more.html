        The connection to my KMS server failed! Trying to connect to another one…
         Please wait…
Sorry! Your version is not supported.

There are two main causes of this issue.

<h2>1. The cause of client</h2>
<p>
First of all, please checkout the latest versions of my scripts 
<a href="https://msguides.com/microsoft-software-products">here</a>.
 Most people have 
trouble using my old ones to activate their apps. Make sure that Windows Update is 
enabled and your intenret connection is stable before running the batch files. 
To check if my KMS servers are blocked or not, please open your internet browser then 
try going to: http://kms8.msguides.com/. If the page is visible, it means this server
 is not blocked.
One other point to note is that you need to run command prompt/batch file with admin
 rights.
</p>

Make sure "administrator" is in the title
Make sure “administrator” is in the title
Otherwise, the connection will be denied by UAC system.

<h2>2. The cause of server</h2>
<p>
Recently I need to do some experiments in the kms7 server so I changed the default KMS
 port (1688) to another one. And besides, I upgraded CPU and RAM memory on the kms
  server.
Because the number of daily clients is too big and still increasing over time, so 
the server can also be stuck at times. You can check and see if the server is overloaded 
or not here: http://status.msguides.com.

If you would have any questions or concerns, please leave your comments.
 I would be glad to explain in more details. Thank you so much for all your feedback
  and support!
